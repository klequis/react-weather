Best practices?





Components are reusable, composable and unit-testable


What I Like
- Very expressive


Building components not templates
> Mix markup with js
  > show some
  > separattion of concerns reduce coupling and increase coheasion
  > coupling: how often do you need to change other parts of your conde
  > cohesion: degreen to which elements of a module belong together
  
Templates are poor separation of concerns - I hate them
- did Druple
- figure where in the DOM 

Answers
- MVC - don't ask me
